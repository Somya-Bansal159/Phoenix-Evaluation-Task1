## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## What do the different parts do?

The detector in the GLTF file contains muon chambers and steel return yoke. Muons can penetrate the matter upto several metres, so muon detectors are placed at the outer edge.
CMS has three types of muon detectors:
1. Drift tubes (DT): These detectors are in the barrel region (orange part) and are used to measure the exact trajectory of the particle.
2. Cathode strip chambers (CSC): These are used in the end caps (yellow region). CSCs are basically pairs of anode-cathode, so when muon passes through them, they knock the electrons off the gas atoms. Positive and negative charges drift towards respective electrodes. They are used to measure particle's position coordinates.
3. Resistive plate chambers (RPC): These detectors are present both in the barrel regions and the end caps, parallel with DTs and CSCs. They also contain anode-cathode pair. These are the gaseous detectors that quickly detect any passing muon.
